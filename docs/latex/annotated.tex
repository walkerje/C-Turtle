\doxysection{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classcturtle_1_1AbstractDrawableObject}{cturtle\+::\+Abstract\+Drawable\+Object}} \\*\mbox{\hyperlink{classcturtle_1_1AbstractDrawableObject}{Abstract\+Drawable\+Object}} is a base class, intended to be inherited from by all drawable objects. This class just contains a simple virtual drawing function, intended to be inherited from and to overload the draw function. This allows for the storage of drawable geometry/etc and attributes in a generic fashion }{\pageref{classcturtle_1_1AbstractDrawableObject}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classcturtle_1_1AbstractTurtleScreen}{cturtle\+::\+Abstract\+Turtle\+Screen}} \\*Abstract type for most turtle functionality. It intentionally excludes all input/output functionality, allowing for two intended derivates\+: an \char`\"{}interactive\char`\"{} screen, vs an \char`\"{}offline rendering\char`\"{} screen. The \mbox{\hyperlink{classcturtle_1_1Turtle}{Turtle}} class doesn\textquotesingle{}t care which one it gets attached to }{\pageref{classcturtle_1_1AbstractTurtleScreen}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classcturtle_1_1BitmapFont}{cturtle\+::\+Bitmap\+Font}} \\*The Bitmap Font represents monospaced font image files that covers a range of lower A\+S\+C\+II. The default font, for example, covers 32-\/127 (e.\+g, char 32 to char 127). This is a particularly naive implementation of bitmap fonts, however, all basic properties required are here }{\pageref{classcturtle_1_1BitmapFont}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classcturtle_1_1Circle}{cturtle\+::\+Circle}} \\*Holds a radius and total number of steps, used to generate and draw a circles geometry }{\pageref{classcturtle_1_1Circle}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classcturtle_1_1Color}{cturtle\+::\+Color}} \\*The primary representation of \mbox{\hyperlink{classcturtle_1_1Color}{Color}} for this library. Represented as a simple R\+GB color composed of unsigned bytes, \mbox{\hyperlink{classcturtle_1_1Color}{Color}} objects can be referenced by string and by packed integer }{\pageref{classcturtle_1_1Color}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classcturtle_1_1CompoundPolygon}{cturtle\+::\+Compound\+Polygon}} \\*Compound \mbox{\hyperlink{classcturtle_1_1Polygon}{Polygon}} instance is composed from a number of smaller parts, which are each derived from \mbox{\hyperlink{classcturtle_1_1AbstractDrawableObject}{Abstract\+Drawable\+Object}}. Compound Polygons can have a variety of attachments. After the parts are assembled, the polygon is essentially read-\/only. These can be used to assemble several pieces of geometry into one object. These objects are self-\/contained and have ownership of all \mbox{\hyperlink{classcturtle_1_1AbstractDrawableObject}{Abstract\+Drawable\+Object}} instances they contain }{\pageref{classcturtle_1_1CompoundPolygon}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structcturtle_1_1InputEvent}{cturtle\+::\+Input\+Event}} \\*The internally-\/used representation of an Input Event. Contains information pertaining to keyboard and mouse events, as well as callback pointers for either case }{\pageref{structcturtle_1_1InputEvent}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classcturtle_1_1InteractiveTurtleScreen}{cturtle\+::\+Interactive\+Turtle\+Screen}} \\*Holds and maintains facilities in relation to displaying turtles and consuming input events from users through callbacks. This includes holding the actual data for a given scene after being populated by \mbox{\hyperlink{classcturtle_1_1Turtle}{Turtle}}. It layers draw calls in the order they are called, independent of whatever \mbox{\hyperlink{classcturtle_1_1Turtle}{Turtle}} object creates it }{\pageref{classcturtle_1_1InteractiveTurtleScreen}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structcturtle_1_1ivec2}{cturtle\+::ivec2}} \\*Represents a coordinate pair (e.\+g, x \& y) This class is represented as a low-\/precision point, because this data type tends to be most easily drawn to a simple canvas }{\pageref{structcturtle_1_1ivec2}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classcturtle_1_1Line}{cturtle\+::\+Line}} \\*Holds two points and the functionality to draw a line between them on a specified canvas }{\pageref{classcturtle_1_1Line}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structcturtle_1_1PenState}{cturtle\+::\+Pen\+State}} \\*The Pen State structure Holds all pen attributes, which are grouped in this way to allow stack-\/based undo for \mbox{\hyperlink{classcturtle_1_1Turtle}{Turtle}} objects. Instances of this object are self-\/contained, and has ownership of all objects and memory referenced by itself }{\pageref{structcturtle_1_1PenState}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classcturtle_1_1Polygon}{cturtle\+::\+Polygon}} \\*The polygon class merely holds a vector of points and a function to draw this series to an image. Please note that the contained series of points must be in either clockwise(\+C\+W) or counterclockwise(\+C\+C\+W) order! }{\pageref{classcturtle_1_1Polygon}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structcturtle_1_1SceneObject}{cturtle\+::\+Scene\+Object}} \\*Turtles append Scene Objects to a list to keep track of what it has drawn (a history). \mbox{\hyperlink{structcturtle_1_1SceneObject}{Scene\+Object}} holds a description of something that needs to be on the screen. It\textquotesingle{}s a general object which encompasses A\+LL things that can be on screen, ranging from stamps, misc. geometry, and strings }{\pageref{structcturtle_1_1SceneObject}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classcturtle_1_1Sprite}{cturtle\+::\+Sprite}} \\*Selection of a larger image. This class ignores color in favor of color provided by the image the sprite corresponds to }{\pageref{classcturtle_1_1Sprite}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classcturtle_1_1Text}{cturtle\+::\+Text}} \\*Basic string that is drawn on the screen. Unfortunately, \mbox{\hyperlink{classcturtle_1_1Text}{Text}} objects are very simple. They have no notion of either text size of font }{\pageref{classcturtle_1_1Text}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classcturtle_1_1Transform}{cturtle\+::\+Transform}} \\*Myriad of functions to simply transform points. This class it the backbone of almost all cartesian plane math in C\+Turtle. An adapted 3x3 matrix of the following link\+: \href{http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials/tutorial-3-matrices/}{\texttt{ http\+://www.\+opengl-\/tutorial.\+org/beginners-\/tutorials/tutorial-\/3-\/matrices/}} }{\pageref{classcturtle_1_1Transform}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classcturtle_1_1Turtle}{cturtle\+::\+Turtle}} \\*The \mbox{\hyperlink{classcturtle_1_1Turtle}{Turtle}} Class Symbolically represents a turtle that runs around a screen that has a paint brush attached to its tail. The tail can be in two states; up and down. As the turtle moves forwards, backwards, left, and right, it can draw shapes and outlines, write text, and stamp itself onto whatever surface it\textquotesingle{}s walking/crawling on (In this case, it\textquotesingle{}s walking on a Turtle\+Screen) }{\pageref{classcturtle_1_1Turtle}}{}
